# MicroAlchemy Primer

We're building tools and collapse the distance between an idea and working silicon. The goal is
simple: **cut fabrication lead times to weeks** so teams can iterate as fast on silicon as they do on code.

<Callout tone="info" title="What we are shipping">
  Wafers in under three weeks, an open-source analog-first design stack (Alembic), and an ecosystem that
  keeps the tooling, simulation, and fabrication loop tight.
</Callout>

## Design loops should be shorter

- Traditional foundries are focused on pushing the economics per transistor rather than design speed
  - It can take anywhere from three months to a full year to go from a finalized design to a chip in hand at today’s foundries
- Analog design is still artisanal; we are raising the abstraction with Alembic.
- Tooling wants to be open; community contributions unlock better models and flows.

## How we approach the stack

1. **Language-first**: Alembic expresses analog intent without drowning in device minutiae.
2. **Tight simulation**: We validate designs against the exact stack we fab on—no surprises at tapeout.
3. **Fast fab**: Our process targets a 1μm node with reliable turnaround for experiments and MVP silicon.
